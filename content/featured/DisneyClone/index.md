Operating System Visualizer is a platform to See The Visualization of algorithms that are being used in operating system Currently we support two classes of algorithms that operating system uses i.e cpu scheduling algorithms and page replacement algorithm.
In Cpu Scheduling we support Preemtive as well as non - preemtive algorithms and in total there are 6 classes of different algorithms in cpu scheduling i.e FCFS, SJF, PRIORTY SCHEDULING,SJF Non Preemtive , Round Robin priority scheduling.
In Page Replacement we have Only have FIFO AND LRU algorithms.
